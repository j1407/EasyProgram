# EasyProgram
Simple Program Collection

minesweeper.c

It is a simple C program written by me.
To change the size, please change the value of SIZE_MAX.
To change the difficulty-level, please change the value of DIFFICULTY.
Since the number of bombs increases in proportion to the difficulty-level, 
it is not yet accurate as a program, so the user should adjust is personally.
If you want to improve GUI, adjust input function and draw function.
Other than that, there is no need to change it.
Please distribute / modify it freely.
